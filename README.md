# Arabic-Text-Classification

This is a mini project in which we are provided with the scrapped dataset from Arabic Newspapers. The data contain and article, it's title and country. This work is done for the practice only. Anyone can use it for learning purposes

## Libraries you need for this are:
* wordcloud
* PIL
* arabic_reshaper
* bidi.algorithm
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

## How to Run
Firstly you need to set the path for the data csv and a arabic ttf file in the wordcloud block. In this code i have implemented only Naive bayes classifier, you can run any classifier on it because it's already preprocessed and ready to feed into a model.
Also I have mentioned all the comments and heading in the code for your understanding
